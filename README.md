# SpiderOnFinance
## Cause:
In the project, we need some illegal financial original data sources that can be crawled effectively, but the number of illegal financial original data sources crawled is not as expected at this stage, so I went to other websites some time ago to visit.
## process:
At this stage, many websites are equipped with certain anti-scrabble technologies. Especially like this kind of financial data source website, the author has skipped some anti-climbing technologies with relatively high technical complexity (such as verification codes, IP blocking, etc.), relevant financial original data sources are crawled for the general anti-picking technology.
## Get started quickly and easily
### Preparation basics:
The author's python version is 2.7.16, the operating system is deepin, and the python editor is Pycharm.
Next, show the actual crawling case.
1. Clone the local python code files, and then use the pycharm editor to open these files.

2. The crawling target is the penalty information disclosure form on the China Banking Regulatory Commission, as shown below

3. Run the requesthtml.py program to get a considerable number of information disclosure forms from the China Banking Regulatory Commission (as shown below)

4. The crawl target is the relevant data of suspicious companies on "Net Loan Eye" (see below)

5. Run P2P.py in the project to get the relevant crawling data information source, crawling and collecting more than 5000 suspicious company data information in the P2P.et file of the project.

6. In addition, there are crawled company financing netizens' evaluation information, etc., so I won't give examples one by one, just run the relevant code.
